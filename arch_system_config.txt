NETWORK
Here, my main options are NetworkManager and systemd-networkd.
Systemd is part of the default archlinux installation and is easy to setup wired
networks on.
    NETWORK MANAGER

    SYSTEMD-NETWORKD
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-networkd
    Enable resoved service `systemctl enable systemd-resolved.service`.
    systemd-resolved provides resolver services for DNS etc.
    Enable the networkd service `systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service`.
    Check your ethernet adapter name with `networkctl list`.
    Add network configuration file in location `/etc/systemd/network`.
    e.g. `/etc/systemd/network/wired1.network`.
    Edit this network configuration file. Here is an example:
    ```
    [Match]
    Name=enp1s0
    [Network]
    DHCP=yes
    ```
    Sart the services or reboot.
